# week5_Minecraft_Assignment
Creating a 2D demo for Minecraft game. 
I created the game background using a function which draw the game background with a table.
Each cell contains different class which indicates its description and purpose.
I created an onclick event function for each cell in the table.  
I created a tool board and onclick event for each tool.

The main difficulty was learning how to change the class of each element by specific conditions.
